This repository summarizes detailed implementation and additional functions used in the manuscript entitled "GUEST: An R package for handling estimation of graphical structure and multi-classification for error-prone gene expression" written by Li-Pang Chen and Hui-Shan Tsao.

1. spe_sen_bias_kl.R: The function "spe_sen_bias_kl" provides values of specificity (SPE) and sensitivity (SEN) and is used to examine the performance of the estimators via simulation studies.

2. small_size(p200_n50).R: The demonstration of the synthetic data with small sample size (n=50) and moderate dimension of variables (p=200) under continuous, binary, or count random variables.

3. small_size(p200_n50).RData: The workspace containing simulation results produced by "small_size(p200_n50).R".

4. small_size(p200_n50).csv: The .csv file summarzing the eestimation result from "small_size(p200_n50).RData" and the record of the computational times.

5. large_size(p500or1000_n500).zip: The workspace containing simulation results based on continuous, binary, and count random variables under n=500 and p=500 or 1000.

6. large_size(p500or1000_n500)_GGM.R: The demonstration of the synthetic data with large sample size (n=500) and high dimension of variables (p=500 or 1000) under continuous variables.

7. large_size(p500or1000_n500)_ISM.R: The demonstration of the synthetic data with large sample size (n=500) and high dimension of variables (p=500 or 1000) under binary variables.

8. large_size(p500or1000_n500)_Counts.R: The demonstration of the synthetic data with large sample size (n=500) and high dimension of variables (p=500 or 1000) under count variables.

9. Theta_not_sparse.R: The estimation for non-sparse precision matrix.

10. Classification.R: The demonstration for classification of the synthetic data.

11. Classification.zip: The workspace containing classification results for the synthetic data.

12. real_data.R: The demonstration of real data analysis.
