This repository summarizes detailed implementation and additional functions used in the manuscript entitled "GUEST: An R package for handling estimation of graphical structure and multi-classification for error-prone gene expression" written by Li-Pang Chen and Hui-Shan Tsao.

1. spe_sen_bias_kl.R: The function "spe_sen_bias_kl" provides values of specificity (SPE) and sensitivity (SEN) and is used to examine the performance of the estimators via simulation studies.

2. small_size(p200_n50).R: The demonstration of the synthetic data with small sample size (n=50) and moderate dimension of variables (p=200) under continuous, binary, or count random variables.

3. small_size(p200_n50).RData: The workspace contains simulation results produced by "small_size(p200_n50).R".

4. small_size(p200_n50).csv: The .csv file summarzing the eestimation result from "small_size(p200_n50).RData" and the record of the computational times.
